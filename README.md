# JalMitra WebApp

**Welcome to the official GitHub Repository of JalMitra, your go-to platform for efficient water-related issue management!**

## Overview

JalMitra is a web application designed to streamline the reporting and resolution of water-related problems in local communities. Empowering both citizens and governing agencies, JalMitra facilitates real-time communication, transparent issue tracking, and efficient problem resolution.

## Features we want to implement in JalMitra

- **Effortless Problem Reporting**: Users can easily report water-related issues by submitting geo-tagged images, eliminating the need for complex bureaucratic procedures.

- **Comprehensive Issue Management**: Government agencies gain a unified platform to view, manage, and track all water-related problems efficiently.

- **Transparency and Resource Tracking**: JalMitra ensures transparency and accountability by allowing authorities to monitor issue resolution progress and track resource expenditures.

- **Leveraging Social Media**: Integration with social media platforms enables citizens to submit reports using the #JalMitra hashtag, minimizing barriers to participation.

- **Raise Awareness About Local Water Issues**: An in-app noticeboard keeps the community informed about ongoing water-related challenges, fostering a sense of collective responsibility.

- **Efficient Issue Tagging**: Machine Learning models expedite report sorting and tagging, making the management of submitted reports efficient for government officials.

- **Citizen Recognition**: Proactive citizens contributing to the community are recognized as "Jal-Yoddhas" on a local noticeboard within the app.

- **Fake Image Detection**: Utilizing technology similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), JalMitra detects and prevents the submission of AI-generated or fake images, ensuring data accuracy.
